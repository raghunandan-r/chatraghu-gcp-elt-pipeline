", "response": "If you receive an email from USCIS saying you should \"self deport\" or else you will be arrested and deported, here are some important things to know:\n\n- Sometimes, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may ask you to sign a document called a \"stipulated order of removal.\" This means you agree to be deported without seeing an immigration judge.\n- Signing this document means you give up your right to a hearing and may be barred from returning to the U.S. for many years or even permanently.\n- You have the right to talk to a lawyer before signing anything.\n- If you have already signed such an order but want to see a judge, you might be able to ask to cancel it if the judge has not yet signed it.\n- Deportation has serious consequences, including losing your permission to stay in the U.S. and possibly facing criminal charges if you return illegally.\n\nBecause this is a serious situation, it is very important to speak with a qualified immigration lawyer who can help you understand your rights and options.\n\nI cannot give legal advice, but I recommend you find legal help as soon as possible.\n\nSource: https://immigrantjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NIJC-KYR-Manual-2025_English_FINAL-20250528-223735.pdf (Sections: STIPULATED REMOVAL ORDERS, DHS’S CHARGES AGAINST YOU, TYPES OF HEARINGS)", "graph_version": "i1.0.0", "timestamp_end": "2025-09-05T00:20:53.010274+00:00", "graph_latency_ms": 5249.737, "time_to_first_token_ms": 2327.428, "evaluation_latency_ms": 3309.9430149886757, "total_latency_ms": 9722.884, "retrieved_docs": [{"content": "### STIPULATED REMOVAL ORDERS: Even if you have the right to see the immigration judge, you may be asked by the DHS to sign a voluntary stipulated order of removal. This is a document that states that you would like to be ordered removed without seeing an immigration judge. This is not a “Voluntary Return” or “Voluntary Departure,” such as the DHS sometimes offers near the border. If you agree to be deported, you will not see the immigration judge. After you sign the order, the immigration judge will review your signed order and enter an order of removal or deportation against you, and you will be barred from returning to the United States, even legally, for ten years, twenty years or permanently depending on the details of your case. You will be subject to all of the additional penalties that come from being deported, if you ever come back into the United States. You have the right to consult an attorney before signing for your removal. You may be eligible for relief from removal and will not be able to pursue that relief if you sign a stipulated order of removal. If you have already signed a stipulated order of removal and now wish to see the judge, you may be able to take back your order if it has not yet been signed by the immigration judge by writing to ICE. If your order has already been signed by the judge, you will need to write to the immigration court right away to ask that the judge reopen your case.

If you entered the United States without permission, or you presented yourself at a port of entry (land border or airport) without proper documents allowing you to enter the U.S., DHS can try to deport you for being in the United States without permission even if you do not have a criminal record. Likewise, if you came on a temporary visa, such as a student or tourist visa, or through the visa waiver program but did not leave the country after your permission to be here expired, DHS can try to deport you for being in the United States without permission even if you do not have a criminal record. If you have permission to be here, such as if you are a lawful permanent resident or refugee, you can still face deportation if you have done something against the law, either in violation of criminal law or civil immigration law. If you do not have permission to live in the United States, DHS can use both your lack of lawful status and criminal history against you.

First, if you are removed, you lose any permission you have to stay in the United States, including any visa that you previously had. Second, if you have lawful permanent resident status, being deported will terminate that status. Third, if you are ordered removed, you cannot legally return to the United States for at least ten years, and in some cases ever, unless you obtain special permission from the United States government to return. It is a crime to reenter the United States illegally after you have been removed. If you reenter the United States illegally after you have been removed from the country, it will be a federal felony offense. If you are caught, you will likely be sentenced to a prison term; if you have been convicted of crimes, particularly aggravated felonies, you could be sentenced to prison for up to twenty years for illegal reentry. In addition, if you reenter without pe rmission, you will not receive any more hearings before the Immigration Court. The Department of Homeland Security is able to “reinstate,” or use once again, your prior order of deportation and deport you again, without allowing you to see an immigration judge. If the immigration judge does enter an order of removal against you, you have the right to appeal this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”).
